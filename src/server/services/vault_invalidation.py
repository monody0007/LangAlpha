"""Convergence after a vault-secret mutation.

A mutation changes secret VALUES, and every config fingerprint in the MCP
machinery hashes ``${vault:NAME}`` reference strings rather than values — so
nothing downstream can see the change on its own. This module is the explicit
compensation, in one place so every door that writes a secret (the vault page,
an import, a plugin install) converges the same way.

Every step is best-effort in that a failure here must never fail the mutation
that triggered it — but "best-effort" stops at the config-version bump, the one
DURABLE convergence trigger: when the work that feeds it fails, the bump still
fires blindly rather than being skipped.
