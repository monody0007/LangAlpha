"""Plugin update: re-validate a fresh package and reconcile owned components.

The diff is keyed by package identity (``plugin_server_key`` / the skills/
directory name), never by row name — renames in the package are a delete +
create. A component is deleted only when its key VANISHES from the package;
a key that is still declared but now invalid keeps its existing row (per-
entry isolation must not turn a package typo into a data loss). Rows the
user detached (plugin_id cleared by an edit) are never touched: an incoming
component whose name exists but is no longer owned is reported ``detached``
and skipped. User-set vault references survive in-place updates: where the
existing row holds a ``${vault:NAME}`` ref, the ref wins over whatever
literal the new package ships at that key.
