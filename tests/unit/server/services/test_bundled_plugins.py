"""The bundles on disk, as the Plugins page and the icon route see them.

``icon_site_for`` is the reason this file exists. It answers an unauthenticated
route whose only input is a name, and it is safe because it matches that name
against the bundles actually on disk rather than joining it onto a path. That
property is stated in a docstring and enforced by one loop; a later refactor to
``BUNDLES_DIR / name`` would read as a simplification and would be a traversal.
