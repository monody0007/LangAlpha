"""The computer's wrapper union and one workspace's overlay on it.

Two tiers. ``_internal/tools/`` holds one wrapper module and one doc tree per
server any workspace on this computer enabled, plus the composed client at
``_internal/src/mcp_client.py``; the agent can reach none of it.
``<ws>/.agents/tools/`` is the tier it does reach: a ``tools`` package of
relative symlinks to the wrappers this workspace enabled, its docs, and the
``mcp_client_config.json`` naming that set. A disabled server has no symlink,
no doc and no config entry, so nothing the agent can read claims a capability
the workspace does not have.

Every mutation of the shared tiers happens in :data:`_SCRIPT`, one in-sandbox
pass holding an flock on the union. The claim ledger is a read-modify-write
over a file several workspaces share, and two turns on one computer sync
concurrently, so doing it host-side loses whichever merge lands second: the
losing workspace's claims vanish and the servers it just dropped keep an
immortal claim nothing will ever release. The version the merge decides is
also what the workspace's own config is stamped with, which is why the stamp
happens inside the lock rather than being guessed before it.
