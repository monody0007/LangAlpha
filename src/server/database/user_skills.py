"""Database CRUD for user- and workspace-tier skills (``user_skills``).

One row per skill a user owns, carrying the denormalized SKILL.md frontmatter
so listings and the per-turn agent build never open the archive. The archive
bytes live in object storage (``archive_key``) or inline (``archive_blob``)
when no object storage is configured.

A row's scope is its ``workspace_id``: NULL = user tier (every workspace),
set = that workspace only. Scope-keyed functions take ``workspace_id`` and
match it exactly (``IS NOT DISTINCT FROM``); a workspace row may reuse a
user-tier name and shadows it there, so name lookups are only unique within
one scope. ``workspace_skill_disables`` records per-workspace disables of
skills the workspace merely inherits (platform + user tier), which have no
row in the workspace scope to flag.

``archive_blob`` is excluded from every read except :func:`get_user_skill_archive_blob`
— it is up to half a megabyte per row, and the hot paths (listing, agent build)
need only the metadata.

``plugin_id``/``plugin_skill_dir`` mark a row as owned by an installed plugin
(written only by the plugin install/update path, always at the user tier).
Every user edit clears them in place — re-upload, move, and the reconciler's
content write-back — which is the fork-on-edit semantic: a name that is
un-owned tells a later plugin update to skip the row rather than overwrite
the customization.

    Returns ``(row, superseded_archive_key)`` — the caller deletes the
    superseded object after the write commits, so a failed upsert can never
    orphan the bytes the surviving row still points at.

    Both caps are per user across every scope, enforced under an advisory
    lock on the user so concurrent uploads can't slip past them. The exact
    row being replaced (scope + name) is excluded from both counts:
    overwriting an existing skill is always allowed.

    On replace, ``enabled`` is preserved (a disabled skill re-uploaded stays
    disabled) while the plugin provenance columns take the caller's values —
    a direct re-upload of a plugin-owned name therefore detaches it, which is
    the fork-on-edit semantic. A detach off a DISABLED plugin additionally
    carries the OFF state onto the row: suppression lived in the delivery
    query's ``plugin_id IS NULL OR p.enabled`` predicate, so clearing the
    provenance would turn a skill the user had switched off at the plugin into
    an unconditionally delivered one. Re-uploading your own copy is not consent
    to start running it. The catalog's fork-on-edit already owes this
    (``services/mcp_catalog.apply_catalog_edit``); this is the same rule on
    the skill half.

    ``owned_by_plugin`` narrows the replace to a row that plugin still owns,
    the write-side counterpart of the delete's predicate. A plugin update
    decides to replace by reading ownership first, then spends a zip
    validation and an object PUT before writing; a Customize landing in that
    window would otherwise be re-adopted under the package's content AND have
    its archive dropped as superseded, which is the one destruction here that
    nothing can undo. Raises ``SkillNotOwned`` instead.

    ``command`` seeds only on insert: the column is
    authoritative after creation, so a re-upload never resets a user's alias.
    The seed is re-checked here under the lock, since the caller chose it
    before spending the object PUT.
