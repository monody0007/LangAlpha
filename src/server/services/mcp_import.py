"""Bulk import of standard ``mcpServers`` JSON into the user's Plugins catalog.

Every door that lands servers from a blob (a workspace's MCP tab, the Plugins
page, a plugin install) accepts the same inline credentials and runs the same
per-entry gauntlet: skip reserved or duplicate names, enforce the account cap,
rewrite credential-looking literals to ``${vault:NAME}`` refs and validate, all
of it pure and writing nothing, then commit the entry's vault secrets and its
server row in ONE transaction. An entry either lands whole or not at all, and
its failure never touches the others. ``catalog_import_scope`` builds what the
doors share; a door supplies only its server writer and the prose for a name
that is taken.
