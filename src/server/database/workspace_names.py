"""A workspace's folder on its computer is its name, so names are the folder rules.

``workspace_folder_name`` is the one spelling of a name as a folder, and
``workspace_name_key`` is what two names must not share per user: the folded
spelling, case-insensitively, because a folder is the thing that collides and
a case-insensitive disk (a Docker bind mount on macOS) cannot hold ``Research``
and ``research`` side by side. Migration 054 carries a frozen copy of these
rules; edit both or the backfill and the app disagree about what is taken.
