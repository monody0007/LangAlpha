"""Fan a package's mcp.json entries into user_mcp_servers rows.

Entries land through the shared import loop, so a plugin install and a
hand-pasted ``mcpServers`` blob get the identical per-entry gauntlet
(reserved names, cap, embedded-credential vaulting, model validation) and
the same per-entry isolation: one bad entry never aborts the others. Legacy
sse entries are held back rather than installed — they are probed and
reported ``upgradable`` for the wizard's consent step.
