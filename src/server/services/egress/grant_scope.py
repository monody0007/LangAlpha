"""Which servers in a resolved workspace earn an egress grant, and of which kind.

One place answers it, because the answer is read by three paths that would
otherwise drift: the sandbox session's bind, the Flash turn's bind, and the
config mutations that retire a grant before replying. A server that earns a
grant on one path and not on another is either a tool the model cannot call or
an authorization overhang, depending on which way the two disagree.

The kind is decided by what authenticates the server, never by what it is
named. An OAuth connection means the relay spends its token; otherwise a
remote row authenticates with its own headers, and the grant names the row so
the relay can resolve them per request.
