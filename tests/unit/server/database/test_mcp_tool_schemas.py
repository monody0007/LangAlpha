"""Snapshot-cache purges that a config fingerprint can't trigger on its own,
and the connection guard that stops a late write from undoing one.

Every MCP config hash covers ``${vault:NAME}`` reference strings, never the
resolved values, so a vault VALUE change churns no fingerprint anywhere. These
tests pin the compensating purges — in particular that the user-tier purge also
clears the per-workspace rows, which is where an inherited server's in-sandbox
discovery actually lands — plus the user-tier upsert's under-lock re-read of the
OAuth connection, which runs in both directions: without it a discovery that
overtakes a disconnect writes its snapshot back, and a header probe that
overtakes a connect publishes the wrong account's tools.
