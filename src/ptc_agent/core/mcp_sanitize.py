"""Sanitization helpers for untrusted (user-configured) MCP server schemas.

Untrusted MCP servers (``source`` ``"user"``) report
arbitrary tool names, parameter names, and descriptions. That text reaches
generated Python code (docstrings, wrapper modules) and the system prompt, so
it is hostile input. These helpers bound identifiers and text before either
boundary.

The ``${vault:NAME}`` reference regex is defined here ONCE
(``VAULT_REF_RE``) and imported by every lane that resolves or validates
vault references — the generated client, the API validator, and the resolver
must agree on the exact syntax.
