 * and had to stay conjunct-for-conjunct identical or the panel would poll for a
 * probe it never runs; `oauthBroken` was recomputed in `McpServerRow` and again
 * one component down in `McpLifecycle`; the lifecycle label and its `data-phase`
 * were derived twice from overlapping conditions. Holding them here makes
 * "these agree" a property of the code rather than of review discipline.
 *
 * The OAuth predicates are written as NEGATIONS of the states that need

 * list someone has to remember to extend when a status is added, and the
 * Plugins page had already grown two of them.
