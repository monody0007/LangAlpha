"""The vendor credential one grant puts on the wire, resolved per request.

A grant stores a reference, never a value, so this is where the two kinds part
company: ``oauth_mcp`` mints a bearer from the connection's token store, and
``header_mcp`` expands the catalog row's own headers against the user's vault,
the tier the row's probe verdict was earned against.
Both are read fresh on every call, which is what makes a rotated key and a
revoked connection take effect on the next request rather than at the next
sync. The same value also rides the sandbox's vault file for every workspace
the user runs, so resolving per request buys rotation and revocation, not
confinement.

Resolution is also the second half of revocation, for either kind. The relay
authorizes against the grant row, and a catalog row that has been deleted,
switched off, taken out of delivery by its plugin, or (for headers) repointed
has no credential to resolve -- so the call is refused here, before anything is
dialled, however long the grant row itself takes to be retired.
