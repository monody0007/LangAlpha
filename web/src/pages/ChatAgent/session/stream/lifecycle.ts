  // composer still offers Stop. And reconnectToStream clears wasStoppedRef on
  // entry, so without this we would resume streaming under a bubble already
  // stamped "Stopped".
  //
  // Navigation is the other, and it is invisible to every existing cancel: the
  // thread-load effect supersedes a cross-thread stream by aborting
  // mainStreamAbortRef, which is null for this entire wait (the disconnected
  // send nulled it and skipped the rest of its cleanup). Ungated, a link that
  // returns after the user opened another thread attaches THIS run's id and
  // cursor to THAT thread — reconnectToStream targets the live threadIdRef,
  // not our tid, so the status check and the stream would disagree about which
  // thread they are for.
  //
  // A newer turn on this same thread is the third, and it is why the stop flag
  // alone is not enough: a fresh send clears wasStoppedRef before opening its
  // own stream, so a stop followed by a send inside one slice leaves this retry
  // looking at its own thread with the flag already reset. It would then either
  // run the give-up cleanup against the live new turn, or reconnect and
  // overwrite that turn's mainStreamAbortRef, putting two readers on one run
  // and leaving Stop pointing at neither.
  //
  // Returning rather than breaking is deliberate in all three cases: the
