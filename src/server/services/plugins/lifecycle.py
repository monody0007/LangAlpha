"""Plugin install / uninstall orchestration.

Install validates everything it can before the first write (fatal manifest
or extension problems never touch the DB), creates the plugin row, then fans
components into the existing primitives. Install is deliberately NOT one
transaction — a crash leaves partial components that ``POST /{name}/update``
reconciles from the stored manifests, which is why the row's content_hash is
stamped last: it claims a tree is installed, and until the fan-out has run
that claim is false. Uninstall IS one transaction, through the component
delete helpers that own the side-effect purges, satisfying the RESTRICT FKs
before the plugin row drops.
