"""Resolve the folder a project owns on its computer, or refuse to guess.

The computer root is not a fallback. A row that names no folder is a row whose
placement nobody has established yet, so a read that cannot answer has to
raise: on the backup path the root makes one project's scan claim its
siblings' files and prune its own manifest, and on the serving path it makes a
scoped share token reach a sibling's report. A caller that genuinely addresses
the machine and no project asks for the root by name (``for_workspace(None)``),
which is why nothing here hands it out as a default.
