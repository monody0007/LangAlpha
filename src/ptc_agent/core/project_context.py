"""Which workspace folder the running turn belongs to.

One ``PTCSandbox`` serves concurrent turns for different workspaces on the
same computer, so the turn's folder cannot be an attribute of the sandbox:
two turns would overwrite each other's. It rides a ``ContextVar`` instead:
execution context, never truth, and an asyncio task inherits it at creation
so a turn's whole task tree reads its own project.

The set has to happen outside the graph. A node runs in a task created from
the *caller's* context, so a ``ContextVar`` set inside one node is discarded
before the next one starts; ``run_with_project`` wraps the turn's stream,
which is where the run's own task begins.
