"""Migration 055: MCP servers and vault secrets belong to the user, chosen per workspace.

A name now means one server and one secret across all of a user's workspaces.
Workspace-local server definitions (``workspace_mcp_servers`` rows with
``source='workspace'``) and the workspace vault are retired. What a workspace
still decides is which of the user's servers run there, through the rows that
already say so: a ``source='user'`` tombstone switches a user server off in one
workspace, a ``source='builtin'`` marker a built-in. Both stay.

Each local server in a live workspace becomes a user server under its own name,
or a suffixed one when the name is taken. An enabled user server runs in every
workspace of its user, so the promoted row is tombstoned everywhere except the
workspace that had it, and there too when it never ran there: switched off, or
under a running built-in's or a brokerage's name, which the resolver skipped;
the operator's ``agent_config.yaml`` says which built-ins ran. Such a copy is
also switched off on the account, where a switched-on row is probed from the
Plugins page and would dial an endpoint nothing used. A local row also
shadowed a same-named user server in its workspace; with the row gone that
server would start running there beside its promoted copy, so the original name
is tombstoned in that workspace as well. A promoted server also starts off in
workspaces created later, as one added from a workspace does now:
``user_mcp_servers.enabled_in_new_workspaces`` is new here, on for every row
already there and off for the promoted ones.

Each workspace secret is copied into the user vault with its ciphertext as it
is: both tiers encrypt with the same key and the same options. A name the user
already holds keeps its value. An equal value collapses into it; a different
one is copied under a suffixed name, and the references in the servers promoted
from that workspace follow the rename. Catalog servers and plugins resolved
against the user vault alone, so none of them could see a workspace's value
before, and a name one of them already asks for is treated as taken too.

Code cannot follow a rename. The sandbox's ``vault.get`` and ``load_env`` read
the workspace's merged set, where its own value won, so code there that asks
for a renamed secret by its old name now gets the account's value or none, and
code importing a renamed server's module no longer finds it. Each workspace's
renames are logged and kept in its ``config`` under ``mcp_migration_renames``,
where the product can show them to its user.

The tables stay, emptied, and refuse the writes that belonged to them: the
previous build keeps serving through the cutover and would otherwise write rows
nothing reads any more. It also creates workspaces without the tombstones a new
one starts with, so an insert trigger on ``workspaces``
(``trg_workspaces_start_mcp_selection``) writes them whichever build inserts.
Rolling back is ``alembic downgrade 054``, run from this build since the
previous one does not know 055, which drops that guard and leaves the data as
055 wrote it, then a redeploy of the previous build. It reads the result
correctly, since it already merges the user tier and honours tombstones. The
new column and the insert trigger stay too: the previous build never reads the
one and still needs the other. The migration that drops the retired tables,
once no build before 055 can serve, drops the guards and the insert trigger.
