 * not injection but authorship: passed through, they put whatever prose a link
 * author chose inside this app's own destructive toast, under this app's own
 * title, on the page where connectors are managed. Both halves go through a
 * closed set instead.
 *
 * It also fixes the ordinary case. The reason is a slug the backend picked for
 * its own logs, and `token_exchange_failed` was being shown to users as-is, in
 * English, on a page that is otherwise translated.
