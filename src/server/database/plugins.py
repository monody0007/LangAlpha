"""Database CRUD for the user_plugins entity.

A plugin row owns bundle identity and the plugin-level enable switch; the
components it installed live in user_mcp_servers / user_skills stamped with
plugin_id (written by their own modules). Everything here is per-user by
(user_id, name), mirroring the catalog idioms in mcp_servers.py.

The enable toggle bumps every workspace's mcp_config_version in the same
transaction: the toggle changes the effective server set through the join
predicate in list_enabled_user_servers, and next-acquire convergence is how
that reaches live sessions. Skills need no version fan-out — the delivery
bundle is recomputed per turn from list_enabled_user_skills, which carries
the same predicate.
