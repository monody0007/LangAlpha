"""The policy an edit to a ``user_mcp_servers`` row owes, in one place.

The write itself is the small part. An OAuth token consented for the old
endpoint must not carry onto a new one, a moved discovery fingerprint strands
the cached tool snapshot, and a user edit of a plugin-owned row forks it away
from its plugin. Spreading those across each caller is what lets one of them
quietly skip a step, so every catalog edit goes through ``apply_catalog_edit``
and the DB layer stays a plain writer.

    ``detach_plugin`` is the fork-on-edit decision: a user edit clears the

    it instead of overwriting the customization, while the plugin update path
    itself passes False to edit its own row in place.

    ``expect_plugin`` is what makes that skip hold under a race. A plugin
    update decides to write by reading ownership first, and a Customize landing
    between that read and this write hands the row to the user; the predicate
    turns the write into a no-op (None) instead of an overwrite of the fork.
    None means the write is unconditional, which is what a user edit wants.

    ``conn`` lets a caller batch the catalog reads and the write onto its own

    inside an open transaction that has already bumped workspace versions would
    self-deadlock: pass ``conn`` only outside one.
