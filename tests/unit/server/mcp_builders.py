"""Shared builders for MCP resolution fixtures.

``resolved_mcp`` assembles a REAL ``ResolvedMCP`` from per-partition lists, so
tests state what they mean ("this server is inherited and tombstoned") instead
of hand-maintaining the derived name sets — and so a change to the resolved
shape breaks the builder once rather than every literal.
