"""Database CRUD for per-workspace and user-level MCP server configuration.

Two concerns live here:
- User-level servers (``user_mcp_servers``): CRUD by ``(user_id, name)``, the
  only place a server is defined. ``enabled`` rows are LIVE config inherited by
  every workspace of the user at resolve time; disabled rows are inert
  templates. Any write of an enabled row, its create included, fans out a
  version bump to ALL the user's workspaces in the same transaction, and
  convergence is next-acquire.
  ``enabled_in_new_workspaces`` is the exception: it reaches only workspaces
  that do not exist yet.
- Per-workspace rows (``workspace_mcp_servers``): selection only, a tombstone
  that switches an inherited server off in one workspace or a marker that
  switches a built-in off. EVERY write bumps ``workspaces.mcp_config_version``
  in the SAME transaction so sessions can detect drift on their next acquire,
  except the tombstones a workspace starts with: they commit with its INSERT,
  before any session could have resolved it.

The discovery schema cache for both tiers lives in ``mcp_tool_schemas``.

Secrets are never stored here — env/header values hold ``${vault:NAME}``
references resolved against the user's vault inside the sandbox.
