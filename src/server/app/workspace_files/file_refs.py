"""Resolve a file reference the agent wrote to one workspace file.

The agent names files loosely: from the workspace root, from the directory of
the document holding the link, by bare name, or at a path it has since moved.
Resolution matches the reference's file name against the real file list, so a
click opens the file the agent meant, or reports that the choice is ambiguous
or that nothing by that name exists, instead of guessing from a stale listing.
