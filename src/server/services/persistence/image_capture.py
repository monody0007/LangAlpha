"""Post-stream safety net: capture sandbox images referenced in SSE events.

``ImageCaptureMiddleware`` rewrites checkpointed messages at model time; the
streamed sse_events still carry sandbox paths, so this hook rewrites them at
persistence time. Keys are content-addressed (shared helpers), so both passes
converge on identical URLs — re-uploads are idempotent PUTs of the same bytes.

No-op when storage is disabled (storage.provider = "none").
