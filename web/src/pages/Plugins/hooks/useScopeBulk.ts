/**
 * The bulk scope actions (all workspaces, only in a chosen set, and, where a
 * tab has workspace-tier rows, move into one) over any selection of rows.
 *
 * The algorithm is the same wherever it runs: a user-tier row is active
 * everywhere minus its deny markers, so "everywhere" and "only in X" both
 * reduce to the per-workspace toggles whose current state differs from the
 * wanted one, and rows the action can't reach are left out of the run rather
 * than failed. On a row with a setting of its own for workspaces not created
 * yet, both also decide that: "everywhere" includes them, and "only in X"
 * excludes them. Only the endpoints and the eligibility rules differ per tab,
 * and those are what the adapter names.
