    Delete files that are no longer present in the sandbox.

    Removes all workspace_files rows whose file_path is NOT in active_paths.

    ``walked_dir_name`` is the folder the scan that produced ``active_paths``
    actually walked, and the statement fires only when the row says the same,
    so a scan of the computer root (or of a sibling's folder) prunes nothing.
    Rows are keyed relative to one directory, which makes a path from the
    wrong directory indistinguishable from a real subdirectory of this one,
    and the only place the two can still be told apart is against the row.

    ``untouched_since`` fences the prune to rows nobody has written since the
    caller's scan began: two syncs may overlap (a post-turn backup and a stop,
    say), and the older scan must not delete a row the newer one just added.
    It is required rather than optional because an unfenced prune against an
    empty ``active_paths`` erases the whole manifest.

        workspace_id: Workspace UUID
