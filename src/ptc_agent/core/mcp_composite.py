"""Per-workspace composite registry (append-only over the frozen built-ins).

A workspace's effective MCP set = the process-global built-ins (taken verbatim,
never round-tripped through the discovery cache) PLUS the workspace's
user-configured servers, whose tool schemas come from the sanitized discovery
snapshot. Nothing here executes a tool: the registry is a schema surface, and
every MCP call happens sandbox-side.

A zero-user-server workspace short-circuits to the built-in registry object
itself (identity), which is what keeps such workspaces byte-identical to the
pre-change behavior (manifest hash + prompt summary unchanged).
