"""Resolving an agent-written path against the turn's workspace.

One question, four things that used to answer it: this module is the only place
that turns what the agent wrote into an absolute sandbox path and decides
whether that path is allowed. The fold itself is pure and lives in
``core.paths``; what is here is the part that needs the live sandbox -- its
root, its allow list, and the turn's workspace folder.
