Five routes, one resolution of the token (``share_access.resolve_shared_files``)

    The token is a thread token, which requires ``allow_files`` and opens its

    subresources with no credential of its own, so whatever route it fetches
    them from is the only thing standing between a scoped token and the rest of
    the workspace.

    Gated on ``allow_files`` only, matching ``read_shared_file``: in this share
    model ``allow_files`` already grants byte access to file content, and
