"""The wizard's two post-install steps, replayed from the stored manifests.

Both write components or credentials after the plugin row already exists, so
both owe exactly what install owes: the fan-out, and the vault invalidation
that follows anything a ``${vault:NAME}`` reference resolves through. They
live here rather than in the router because that invalidation is a step a
second write path can silently omit, and one already had.
