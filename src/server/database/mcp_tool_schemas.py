"""Discovery schema cache for MCP tool snapshots — workspace and user tiers.

Both tables have the same shape and are keyed by ``(owner, server_name,
config_hash)``: a per-server config fingerprint, so adding or toggling an
unrelated server never orphans a snapshot. The SQL therefore lives here once,
parameterized by a ``_SchemaTier`` descriptor — the tiers differ only in the
owner column and in the user tier's extra ``schema_digest``, which lets OAuth
fan-out fire only when tool content actually changed.

Snapshot reads are deliberately decoupled from ``workspaces.mcp_config_version``
(that lives in ``mcp_servers``): the caller compares a row's ``config_hash``
against the server's CURRENT fingerprint to decide hit vs. stale.
