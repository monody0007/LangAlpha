"""Fan a package's ``skills/`` directories into user_skills rows.

Each plan goes through the same ``validate_skill_archive`` pipeline as a
direct upload, so a plugin can never install a skill the upload path would
reject. Per-skill isolation throughout: a name collision, a contested
trigger, or a failed archive store drops that skill only and is reported.

Two phases, because the work divides cleanly by whether order matters.
Deciding a plan's fate and storing its archive are independent per skill and
are the expensive half (a thread to unpack, a storage round trip to write), so
they run concurrently. Creating the rows is not independent: the writes
serialize on the same per-user advisory lock anyway, and each skill's slash
command is seeded against the ones already created, so that half stays a loop
in plan order, which is also the order the report reads back in.
