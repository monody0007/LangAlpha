/**
 * One shipped brokerage, in whichever of its two states the user is in: an
 * offer with no row behind it yet, or their own catalog row.
 *
 * Both states are one row rather than two components because the second state
 * is the first one plus a row — the identity, the vendor's constraints and the
 * description never change, and rendering them from two places is how the two
 * would eventually disagree about a broker that can place orders.
 *
 * Every action here is the same mutation the MCP tab's row calls, so a
 * brokerage has exactly one implementation of connect, toggle, scope and
 * remove no matter which surface the user found it on. What this row does not
 * offer is Edit: the address is the one thing we pick rather than the user, so
 * changing it means going to the tab where it is an ordinary server.
